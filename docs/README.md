# Gulp Starter Kit Documentation

Quick and simple documentation to help you get started.

## Folder structure
Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder or cloned you'll see something like this:
```

Before you start, have a look at these files for a better understanding how **Gulp Starter Kit** works:
- babel.config.js
- .browserslistrc
- config.yml
- gulpfile.babel.js
- package.json

It's recommended that you keep the folder structure as it is to avoid headaches :wink:. However you are free to rename the `fonts` & `img` folder as CSS & HTML are referring to them, but you need to modified the config.yml file.

`src/assets`  
Anything you put in here will be copied to `dist/assets` except for these folders:
- src/assets/js
- src/assets/img
- src/assets/scss

`src/assets/fonts`  
This folder contains the Font files of your project. Anything you put in here will be copied by default to `dist/assets/fonts`.

`src/assets/img`  
This folder contains the Image files of your project. Files with these extension `jpg,jpeg,png,gif,svg,webp` will be copied by default to `dist/assets/img`. In production only files with these extension are compressed: `gif,jpg,jpeg,png,svg`.

`src/assets/js`  
This folder contains the JavaScript files of your project. By default only `app.js` will be compiled and the output folder is `dist/assets/js`.

`src/assets/scss`  
This folder contains the SCSS files of your project. By default only `app.scss` will be compiled and the output folder is `dist/assets/css`.

`src/pages`  
This folder contains the HTML files of your project. Any HTML files in
 this folder will be compiled and copied to `dist` except for these folders: `layouts`, `macros` & `partials`.  
**Please notice that we are using Nunjucks.**

`src/data/data.yml`  
You can use this file to define reuseable data for Nunjucks to speed up your development.

## FAQ
- [CSS prefix doesn't work in development](#css-prefix-doesnt-work-in-development)

### CSS prefix doesn't work in development
By default we only enable CSS prefix in production. If you really need to enable it in development, you can edit the `gulpfile.babel.js` file.
